📖 RAG-Based-Information-Retrieval-System

🚀 This project demonstrates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** that combines a **retriever** and a **large language model** to deliver **accurate, document-based answers**.  
Unlike standard LLMs, this model responds **only on the basis of the information present in the provided documents** — ensuring factual accuracy and eliminating outside content.  

📂 Document Retrieval → Efficiently fetches relevant information using vector search.
---

🤖 LLM-powered Generation → Generates accurate, context-aware answers.
## 🚀 Features

🛠️ Full-Stack Integration → Exposed as a seamless API / web interface for real-world use.
- 🔍 **Efficient Retrieval**: Finds relevant documents from a knowledge base.  
- 🧠 **Context-Aware Generation**: Uses LLMs to generate responses grounded in retrieved documents.  
- ⚡ **Improved Accuracy**: Reduces hallucinations by augmenting the LLM with factual context.  
- 🛠️ **Customizable**: Plug-and-play retrievers (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone) and LLMs (OpenAI, HuggingFace).
